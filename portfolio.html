        <h2><strong>Why Programming</strong></h2>
        <p>Here are some reasons  why I decided to take a programming class:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I wanted to be in a position to think more logically and be in a position to solve problems.</li>
          <li>I am so interested in technology.</li>
          <li>Programming  has become integral to every industry nowadays.</li>
          <li>Programming offers remote working opportunities unlike other industries.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>Here is a list of projects i have created:
    <ul>
      <li>Media-query</li>
      This is a media query website illustrating the use of media types,media features,breakpoints that can be used 
      to change the appearance of the site depending on the size of screen a user uses ,that is,whether a mobile,
      desktop etc.I used both HTML and CSS to come up with this website.
      Here is a link of how to access it : 
       <a href="https://abijahkabiro.github.io/media-query/">Media-query</a>

       <li>My-first-webpage</li>
       This is website that uses block elements such as head,paragraph ,ordered and unorder lists,inline elements such as em,
       strong,the anchor tag and also images.It has also used an external css which has been to the html file.So I 
       used both HTML and CSS while creatin it.Here is a link of how you can access it on my Github account:
